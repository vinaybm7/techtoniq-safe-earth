# Techtoniq - Predict, Prepare, Protect

Techtoniq is an AI-powered earthquake prediction and safety platform that helps users anticipate seismic events, prepare effectively, and protect what matters most. This repository contains the Next.js application with serverless API routes for handling subscriptions and other backend functionality.

## üöÄ Features

- **Robust MongoDB Connection**: Optimized for serverless environments with connection pooling and retry logic
- **Serverless API**: Built with Next.js API routes for seamless deployment on Vercel
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Production-Ready**: Environment-specific configurations and error handling
- **Health Check**: Built-in health check endpoint for monitoring

## üîí Environment Variables

### Local Development
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Required
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional
MONGODB_DB_NAME=techtoniq

   - Add IP address `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere
   - For production, restrict to Vercel's IP ranges:
     ```
     76.76.14.0/24
     100.24.0.0/16
     172.64.0.0/13
     2600:1f1c:2b9:6900::/56
     ```

4. **Get Connection String**:
   - Go to Database ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Connect your application
   - Copy the connection string
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<database>` with your actual credentials

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Earthquake Prediction**: Advanced seismic pattern analysis using Google Gemini API to forecast potential events
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Get customized risk evaluations based on your location and real-time data
- **Intelligent Alert System**: Receive prioritized notifications with AI-analyzed threat levels and recommended actions

## üåê Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure the following settings:
   - Framework Preset: `Vite`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Add `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key
4. Deploy the application

### Deploying to Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key
4. Deploy the application

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key for AI predictions

You can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys for local development.

## Production Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel/Netlify (or other) deployment dashboard:

- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required for AI predictions)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Set to `/api` (default for Vercel/Netlify serverless API routes)

If you see errors like 'Failed to load prediction. Using sample data.' in production:
- Make sure the above environment variables are set.
- Ensure your API route (`src/pages/api/fault-lines.ts`) is deployed and accessible at `/api/fault-lines`.
- Do not use static export unless you deploy your API separately.

## MongoDB Environment Variables (Required for Subscriptions)

Set these in your Vercel/Netlify (or other) deployment dashboard:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string (required for subscriptions)
- `MONGODB_DB_NAME`: (Optional) Your database name (defaults to 'techtoniq')
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`

If you see errors like 'Subscription failed' in production:
- Make sure the above environment variables are set.
- Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from your deployment (IP whitelist).
- Only one subscribe API handler should exist: `src/pages/api/subscribe.ts`.
